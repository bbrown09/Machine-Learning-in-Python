# Machine-Learning-in-Python
Partner project using machine learning to predict whether or not a flight would be delayed by more than 15 minutes

This was a project I did in school so I also included the original instructions.

Open the Classification.pdf to get a summary of the assignment or read the Project 2 Executive Summary.pdf to hear about our results.
